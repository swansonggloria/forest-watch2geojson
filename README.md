# forest-watch2geojson

Convert the forest-watch.csv on https://github.com/Sinar/sinar.myreps/blob/master/docs/forest-watch.csv
to GeoJSON

Take the forest watch csv, and generate a GeoJSON file that you can use in other places,
including: githin.com which processes it automatically, or http://geojson.io/ where you can
just copy/paste the GeoJSON text file and get them on a map.
